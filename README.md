# Moodle_Log_Data_Analysis

## User, Teacher, and Student classes.
Moodle users are authenticated users who access the platform without a specific role. They are assigned the Student role as soon as they enrol in a course. They get the Teacher role if they teach in a course. 
This means that a user can be both a teacher in a course and a student in another course.
Any other form of role can be built by starting with the User superclass.
